ABOUT CRYPTO CURRENCY MULTISTRATEGY FUND <Pilot Fund>
1.	<general>
a.	MultiFIre is a digital asset venture fund, based on the block chain, which aims to bridge the gap between large and small investors.  Using machine-driven analytics, among other researched factors, MultiFire will gain exposure to the block chain ecosphere in a variety of ways while maintaining strict risk management.
i.	WHAT SPECIFIC PROBLEM ARE YOU SOLVING?
b.	We are trying to solve two major problems in the crypto sphere:
c.	Transparency: have you ever invested in something and not really know where you money goes or how it is spent?  Since MultiFire is based on the block chain, there will be 100% transparency and traceability at the click of a button.
d.	 Human element: have you ever bought a coin while it is spiking in price because you just couldnâ€™t help yourself, only to find out the price plummets soon thereafter?  MultiFire will remove the human emotion while trading, using machine-driven analytics.  MultiFire will also use machine-driven analytics and other human studies to maximum value throughout the entire block chain ecosystem.
